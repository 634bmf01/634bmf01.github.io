	<p>&emsp;Edwin A. Abbott was born in 1838 in Middlesex, which is now a part of the Greater London Area, just as the Victorian Era was getting started. This era lasted through most of Abbott's life and would shape his views of the world, as well as the world he would create later in his life. Educated at St. John's College with a storied career in academics, Abbott dedicated his life to literature, intellectualism, and teaching. Abbott was a highly regarded educational figure, working as the headmaster of the City of London School-- where he went to high school-- from 1865 until he retired in 1889. Afterwards, he dedicated his life to his love of writing and authoring books about the subjects he was most fascinated in. He did not retire due to old age, but rather so he could spend more time pursuing his personal desires, which really began to take shape in the 1870s.</p> 
	<p>&emsp;As headmaster, Abbott wrote many books about writing and grammar, scholarly work on Sir Francis Bacon, religion, and literary criticism. But his most well-known work is his 1884 novella <i>Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions</i>, a book about a square in a <a href="construction.html">two-dimensional world called Flatland</a> visiting and exploring other dimensions, such as a one-dimensional world known as Lineland, a three-dimensional world known as Spaceland, and a world with no dimensions known as Pointland. Abbott wrote the book as a satirical novel that skewered the cultural norms, arrogance, and repressive social codes of Victorian England. Abbott, however, took this to such extremes that the book is thought by some to be a dystopian novel. This would put Abbott as one of the grandfathers of dystopian literature among H.G. Wells, Jack London, and Jules Verne. The book was highly regarded when it was released in 1884, but didn't sell well, and didn't achieve popularity for years. Abbott would die in 1926, hardly knowing if his book would ever make a lasting impact outside of a small circle <a href="bibliography.html">(O'Connor and Robertson, 2005)</a>.</p>
	<p>&emsp;It wasn't until the 1920s that the book began to take hold on culture, thanks to the work of Albert Einstein, specifically the theory of relativity, which opened the possibility of a fourth dimension beyond our own. Today, <i>Flatland</i> is held as a masterpiece of science fiction, as well as mathematical fiction, and has been praised by people we know today like Steven Hawking and Carl Sagan. But the story itself has developed a meaning of its own and has resulted in the phrase <a href="construction.html">"escaping Flatland"</a> being added to our lexicon. Simply put, this refers to our creations on paper and screens being filled with information and data so much so that they become immersive and metaphorically jump out of the paper/screen, like the square from <i>Flatland</i> being pulled out of his two-dimensional world  by the sphere, and entering a higher, third dimension beyond his. Flatland, and the phrase "escaping Flatland" has been applied to all kinds of fields that use graphics and map-making to convey information, such as science, mathematics, and geography.</p>

	<p>&emsp;The Victorian Era in England lasted from 1837 to 1901, coinciding with the reign of Queen Victoria. During this time, England became a global power, but also underwent dramatic economic and political changes. The First Industrial Revolution had concluded by the time Victoria ascended to the crown, and the Second Industrial Revolution would forever alter the economy of Great Britain and send shockwaves around the world. With the introduction of concepts like mass production, the revolutionizing of the production of steel and iron, significant improvements in agriculture, and the creation of machines like the steam engine, population and economic growth would steadily rise for decades. Railroads were constructed all over the country. Factories, buildings, and a massive telegraph grid spread across the land like wildfire. People would migrate to the big cities in flocks. Massive social change was on the horizon. But Victorian England was culturally conservative, which heavily repressed and prevented any chance of a major upheaval in society of the likes that happened in other countries like France, Italy, Russia, and Germany.</p>
	<p>&emsp;Even though Parliament's responsibilities and power expanded throughout the Victorian Era, its backdrop was a strongly conservative culture. Both the middle and upper classes despised revolutionary violence and held contempt for the political movements that were going on outside of the country, such as Marxism and socialism. The aristocracy of the country would weaken politically, but their grasp on the social aspect of life was still white-knuckle tight. This meant that Victorian England was rigidly organized on hierarchy, mostly by gender and class. Men were strong, were supposed to act strong, were involved in public life and politics, and sex was their purpose in life. Women were supposed to be weak and sensitive, involved in the private life back at the house, responsible for motherhood, cleaning, and religion, and reproduction was their purpose in life. This was all based on the doctrine of separate spheres, of which men and women were forbidden to cross, however sexist it may be. The wealthy and powerful in England held titles, owned most of the land in the country, and presided over politics with an iron fist <a href="bibliography.html">(Steinbeck, 2022)</a>. The middle class would make considerable gains in power over the years, but the aristocracy fervently held on to whatever power they had left. The lower class was all but shut out of politics, and lived and worked in brutal, unsanitary conditions. Even children were subject to the brutality of industrial work at the time. However, class mobility was higher than one would think based on the description given of society, which ultimately prevented a violent upheaval that happened elsewhere around the world.</p>
	
	<p>&emsp;One could say that Victorian England was an extremely judgmental society. It is worth noting that Anglican Church held unquestionable moral power in England at the time. Every class viewed each other with strong disdain somehow, often through the lens of religion, especially if one was of a lower class than them. The lower class were viewed as dirty, expendable, uncultured, and hostile to intellectualism by the middle and upper classes. At the same time, though, Victorian England as a society a whole was closed-minded, and refused to entertain the more liberal ideas that spread in the rest of Western Europe at the time. The upper and middle classes got along somewhat amicably through work, but the lower class despised the upper class, thinking of them as pompous, obnoxious, and controlling. The lower class also wasn't fond of the middle class, angry at their mobility in society that the lower class didn't really have. Dress codes were very strict, prim and proper, and modest. To have stained, torn, revealing, or baggy clothes was to be seen as a piece of trash. To have a physical deformity was to be seen as an abomination to God, and breaking the rules of nature <a href="bibliography.html">(Falk, 2012)</a>. These types of behaviors have created stereotypes of British people, aristocracy, and the monarchy that persist today.</p>
