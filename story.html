	<p>&emsp;The main story of the book begins in the second half of the book. It starts shortly before New Year's Day in the year 2000, based off of the universe's calendar. Our main character is a square whom we'll call the Square. While the Square is sleeping, he dreams of visiting a one-dimensional world called Lineland and tries to convince their inhabitants of a higher dimension. They take offense to this suggestion, and end up executing the Square in response. When the Square wakes up, he is visited by a Sphere from Spaceland. The inhabitants of Spaceland are solids that live in a three dimensional world, exactly like the world that you and me inhabit. Spaceland's inhabitants can move unimpeded throughout their universe, and are capable of seeing and comprehending depth. To the inhabitants of Flatland, however, they look like what is displayed in the animation to the right. Imagine the beige-colored surface is Flatland, and the green sphere is the Sphere from Spaceland. You will see what he looks like to the Square as he passes through Flatland. At every turn of the millennium, the Sphere visits Flatland as an apostle, in an attempt to convince the inhabitants of Flatland of a third dimension. The Square, however, is not impressed by this display. So the Sphere takes the Square out of Flatland, and into the third dimension.</p>
	
	<p>&emsp; The Square is astonished by what he sees in Spaceland. The Square can now see all of Flatland on a plane, and watch everything going on in the universe. He can see that a trial is going on in Flatland that is held every millennium against those who claim to have any sort of knowledge or vision of a higher dimension, not unlike the Salem Witch Trials in our world. Any shapes found guilty are eternally imprisoned or sentenced to death. The Square recognizes his brother at the trial, and tries to jump back into Flatland and convince him of Spaceland's existence. The Sphere follows him, and descends into the courtroom to proclaim the existence of a third dimension to the inhabitants of Flatland. The Circles are offended by this display, and declare the Square and Sphere to be heretics. They are forced to run away from Flatland before they are arrested. Simply for witnessing this spectacle, the Square's brother is arrested.</p>
	
	<p>&emsp; Back in Spaceland, the Sphere tries to introduce the Square to his three-dimensional counterpart, the Cube. The Square now questions if there is a fourth dimension beyond that of Spaceland, which offends the Sphere greatly. Disgusted by his impudence and constant questioning, the Sphere kicks the Square out of Spaceland and back into Flatland. Once there, the Square tries to enlighten the denizens of Flatland about what he saw in Spaceland, and the concepts of a third dimension. The Square starts working on a memoir about the third dimension, which turns out to be the book <i>Flatland</i> of which we are reading. Yes, the entire book of <i>Flatland</i> is a memoir written by the square. As the Square tries to spread the word of his book, and enlighten Flatland about a third dimension, he is arrested and sentenced to eternal imprisonment by the Circles. The Square will spend the rest of eternity imprisoned, to prevent his knowledge of Spaceland from ever disseminating, and to eliminate even a scintilla of a chance of any sort of revolution or upheaval that would destroy the class structure of Flatland. The Square will never be able to spread his word and convince others of a higher dimension, but he leaves that work up to you, the reader.</p>
