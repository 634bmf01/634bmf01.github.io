	<p align="center">&emsp;This is a a bump map of Crater Lake and its surrounding areas in Crater Lake National Park in Oregon. Some of the data used to create this map was given by the professor, such as the shading for elevation and the data behind it. A MDOW hillshade layer was added to this map to create the topography of Crater Lake. Some data was also given to map out vegetation. Conifers are mapped out in a more greenish color, while sedge is mapped out by more brownish colors. The gradient in the conifers is intended to simulate cones, while the gradient in sedge is intended to imitate hemispheres. A gradient was used to create a sun glint of the lake for even further realism. You can even see some of the topography underwater if you look closely.</p>

	<p align="center">&emsp;Here's a closeup of the map so you can see the gradients of the conifers and sedge intended to simulate three-dimensional shapes. The bright color in the middle of the conifers is intended to simulate the point of a cone. This is because conifers are tall trees, while sedge is short bushes and shrubbery.</p>
