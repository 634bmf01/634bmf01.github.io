	<p>&emsp;So what does it mean to escape Flatland? It depends on what context one is thinking of. Because the phrase "escaping Flatland" can be applied to several different fields of science. If one were to do a search "escaping Flatland" through a search engine such as Google or Bing, one would find results relating to medicine, journalism, and even art. But they all have one common definition created by Edward R. Tufte, a professor of statistics and data at Yale University. According to him, "[escaping] Flatland is the essential task of envisioning information...". What does this mean? Tufte further elaborates by saying that to escape Flatland, one must "increase (1) the number of dimensions that can be represented on plane surfaces and (2) the data density (amount of information per unit area)" <a href="bibliography.html">(Tufte, 1990)</a>. But this doesn't answer the question completely about what it means to escape Flatland. Who is escaping Flatland in this situation? And what does this have anything to do with cartography and map making? The answer: if your maps escape Flatland, they will be so rich with dimensions (different forms of information in this context) and information that the map becomes immersive and their concepts more tangible to the viewer. In other words, the maps may seem to be jumping out of the paper they're printed on or the screen they're displayed on, like how the Square is able to escape the planar world of Flatland and into Spaceland. Maps that successfully escape Flatland are rich with information, and are immersive to viewers. One of the finest examples of maps that successfully escape Flatland was created in 1869 by French civil engineer Charles Minard, depicting Napoleon's ill-fated invasion of Moscow in 1812.</p>

	<p>&emsp; What does this picture mean? For starters, the beige-colored band stretching across the map from left to right represents Napoleon's troops on the march. His attempted invasion of Moscow began at the Nemen River near the town of Kovno, in what is now Lithuania. Also displayed on the map is the number of troops present at each point of the invasion. Napoleon's army started out with an estimated 450,000 troops. Along the way, the invading forces split up into two battallions to occupy what is now Riga, Latvia and Minsk, Belarus (the battle took place in the nearby town of Gorodechno). But as the army advanced deeper into what is now Belarus and then Russia, troops fell ill, supply lines began to break down, and the army encountered fierce resistance from the locals. Napoleon's army began to quickly thin out from disease, desertion, and attacks from the locals. In accordance to this, the beige band becomes thinner and thinner leading up to Moscow. By the time Napoleon's army finally reached Moscow, it had shrunken to 100,000 troops from 450,000. Napoleon was able to put Moscow under his occupation, but it only lasted for shortly more than a month. And during this time, Cossack soldiers put up fierce resistance to his army through guerilla warfare. Afterwards, Napoleon's army was forced to retreat to avoid being surrounded and attacked. The retreat is marked on the map by a band in black. And that's when the brutal Russian winter set in. On the bottom of the map is a graph of temperature connected to each point on the map. For instance, as the retreating army reached Smolensk, even more troops had froze to death from the cold, which was reaching -21&deg; R&eacute;amur. To convert R&eacute;amur to Celsius, you take the temperature in R&eacute;amur and multiply it by 1.25 or 1 and &frac14;. In this case, when the retreating army reached Smolensk, the temperature was about -26&deg; Celsius or about -15&deg; Fahrenheit. Napoleon's army had shrunken to less than 37,000 troops by now. Passing by Minsk and Riga, the troops occupying those areas also began to retreat as well, and were also thinned out by the winter weather, which got even worse, with temperatures plunging to -30&deg; R&eacute;amur (-37.5 &deg;C or -35.5&deg;F). By the time the defeated army made it back to the Nemen, where the invasion started, only 10,000 troops or so were left. Estimates were not well kept in the early 19th century, but it is known that hundreds of thousands of troops died on the way to Moscow, and on the way back. This would destroy Napoleon's aura of invincibility, and mark the beginning of the end of his empire.</p>
	
	<h3 style="border-bottom:1px solid gray;">How Minard's Map Escapes Flatland:</h3>
	<p>&emsp; Charles Minard's map is able to escape Flatland through the copious amounts of information is able to depict on just one piece of paper, of which it has been lauded by geographers and cartographers for. His map has been praised over the years for depicting six types of data across two dimensions: the number of troops, position (and thus, latitude and longitude), distance travelled, temperature, direction of travel, and date. For helpful reference, Wikipedia user Inigo Lopez Vazquez modernized Minard's map and even translated it into English.</p>

	<p>&emsp;As mentioned before, this map depicts the number of soldiers in the invasion by placing numbers at specific points in the invasion, as well of the width of each band. According to Minard's map, translated into English, 1 millimeter of width on the bands equal 10,000 troops <a href="bibliography.html">(Minard, 1869)</a>. Latitude and longitude can be deciphered from locating real life geographic features depicted on the map, such as the Moskva River, as well as cities like Minsk, Moscow, and Vitebsk. Distance on the map is shown on a ruler in leagues (1 league is about 3.45 miles). Temperature is depicted on a map below, and the dates are also attached to data points on this graph, corresponding to the retreat. The retreat began on October 24th, and lasted into December. With all this information, it's hard not to imagine yourself as a part of Napoleon's invading army, as if you were actually there. This is how Minard's map is able to escape Flatland, by making it seem so real, the map and its information almost seem to jump right out of the page, like it's escaping Flatland and spreading out into your world. Good mapmakers create immersive maps capable of channeling copious amounts and channels of data into the viewer's mind without overwhelming them. And due to the tsunami of information and data that has enveloped us with the rise of computers and the digital age, it is more important than ever for maps to escape Flatland. One day, it may almost literally do so through the use of holograms.</p>
