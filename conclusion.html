	<p>&emsp; This book was not an easy read for me at first, and to be honest, it was a bit hard at first to keep my interest while I was reading <i>Flatland</i> for my class. But after a little bit of research, browsing the web for explanations and other stuff, my opinions on this book have taken a turn for the better. It's not an easy book for anyone to read, but being able to understand the meaning behind the book is worth it in the end. I was able to grasp the concept that this book was satirizing Victorian England, but I think it satirizes another part of history even better: the Puritan era of New England. In the early 1600s, as English colonists were moving into what is now Massachusetts, a sect of Protestants known as Puritans were moving in along with them. After the Anglican Church was founded in 1534, separating England from the Roman Catholic Church, some people believed that this movement didn't go far enough, and that the church was still tainted from Catholic influence. The Puritans wanted to eradicate all traces of Catholicism in the English church, and settled in colonies across the Atlantic to create their utopia. It ended up being a nightmarish theocracy, rife with persecution. Puritans were extremely intolerant of religious dissent, did not believe in freedom of speech or the press, and would retaliate with violence. Anyone accused of witchcraft or religious dissent were arrested, publicly humiliated, and often executed. This violence reached its nadir with the Salem Witch Trials in 1692 and 1693. Across the pond, Puritans were the dominant religion in England from the Second Civil War until the Restoration, and witch trials happened there too, but not quite as fervently as in Massachusetts. This would end with the Toleration Act of 1688 in England, and would influence the writing of the First Amendment back in the United States about a century later. </p>
	
	<p>&emsp;At the same time as Victorian England, there was another movement that was making waves through English culture: Romanticism. This movement was in response to the Industrial Revolution and the Enlightenment, and represented a longing for the past that had been long gone, a return to the way life was before the 18th century. Romantic authors like William Wordsworth, John Keats, and Lord Byron were popular in England during Edwin Abbott's childhood and into his early adulthood years. Evidently, by the depiction of his world of Flatland, Abbott was not a fan of Romanticism either. I would argue that <i>Flatland</i> isn't just a satire of Victorian England, but of the Puritan Era, and Romanticism. Chapter 18 of this book is what stuck with me the most, and is what shaped my opinion of the book that I am currently sharing with you. Just the idea of the Square's brother being arrested for simply witnessing a sphere really reminded me of a witch trial. This scene was a demonstration of the zealotry of the Circles and Polygons in how insistent they were of maintaining the power structure of Flatland. It was this kind of zealotry and repression that also made me think of dystopian novels like <i>1984</i> by George Orwell, <i>Brave New World</i> by Aldous Huxley, and <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> by Ray Bradbury. Though there was no Big Brother, memory holes, or telescreens in <i>Flatland</i>, the inhabitants of the world exhibited the same kind of brainwashing that the citizens exhibited in the book. In a way, you can say that the Square is made out of the same mold as Winston Smith. I also was reminded of <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> by the intolerance each of the shapes exhibited for different ideas that would require them to think beyond what they are capable of, namely, the existence of a higher dimension than them. Though the residents of Flatland did not have firemen to burn books, they still chose to swiftly arrest the Square, except he wasn't able to escape like Guy Montag was. And the class structure of Flatland reminded me of the class structure that existed in <i>Brave New World</i>, even with the subsets of triangles (Isosceles and Equilateral) being like each caste of <i>Brave New World's</i> being split into plus and minuses. But unlike <i>Brave New World</i>, the caste system of <i>Flatland</i> had some sort of mobility, albeit very slow, while the former's had absolutely no mobility whatsoever. Some scholars claim that <i>Flatland</i> is among the first dystopian novels ever written, a claim of which I would agree.</p>
	
	<p>&emsp; In conclusion, <i>Flatland</i> is a difficult, but ultimately rewarding book to read. I do believe that the book effectively satirized Victorian England, but also skewered the Puritans in the process, and serves as one of the first dystopian novels ever written. It took me a bit of time to process, but I was surprised at how literal the meaning of escaping Flatland really was. I would never have guessed before I took this course that escaping Flatland simply meant making maps so detailed and full of information that they metaphorically jump out of the page by being so immersive. I would have guessed a much more complicated explanation, but I guess I overthought things this time. And now that I think of it, it really is imperative that maps and charts are able to escape Flatland. The 21st century will be defined by an ocean of information and data that is growing exponentially as we speak. Without graphicacy and leaving the maps trapped in Flatland, we will surely drown in this ocean of information, and resort to disinformation and propaganda. Unfortunately, this is quickly happening all around us as we speak with the advent of Trumpism and anti-intellectualism tightening its grasp on the American mind. Scientists are having great difficulty in recent times being able to convey their grandiose experiments and research to the public, which has presented opportunities for snake oil salesmen to take advantage of people, as we've seen with the anti-vaxx movement that really gained steam during COVID-19. Thankfully, improving one's sense of graphicacy, as well as the other senses of knowledge (numeracy, literacy, articulacy, etc.) will be valuable tools in combating disinformation that is being thrown at us on a regular basis, and creating maps that can escape Flatland will only aid us further in navigating the ocean of information that will only continue to grow as the 21st century rolls on. Creating quality maps, graphics, and visual representations of data could actually save millions of lives one day. Maybe then we can escape from the Flatland of our minds, and into the world of knowledge.</p>
