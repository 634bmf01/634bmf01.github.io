	<p>&emsp;When you think of ghost towns, what kinds of places come to mind? Pripyat? Picher, Oklahoma? Gold mining towns in California? How about Kansas? Because Kansas has many ghost towns all over the state, with most of them being in the western half. If you looked at my webmap, you would notice how many towns west of Wichita and Salina are so small, except for Garden City and Dodge City. The western half of Kansas is not as populated as the eastern half of the state, and many ghost towns and near ghost towns are out there. In this project, I'm going to use some data that I was given to complete an assignment in one of my classes to map out the decline in population in counties in Western Kansas and observe trends. We want to answer questions like these:</p>
	<ul class="questions">
		<li>Which counties in Western Kansas have shrunken the fastest?</li>
		<li>Have any counties in Western Kansas increased in population?</li>
		<li>When did most counties in Western Kansas begin shrinking in population?</li>
		<li>How has the construction of the Interstate affected the population of Western Kansas?</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 style="border-bottom:1px solid gray;">Methodology:</h3>
	<p>&emsp;In this project, I will be using the R computer language to manipulate the data that I am working with. The data I am using in this project was given to me as part of my assignments in GEOG 602 at Kansas State University. <a href="KansasCensus.csv" download>The data can be downloaded by clicking this link.</a> I will also have to explain what I mean by Western Kansas before we get too far ahead into this assignment. In other words, I have to show what the study region of this project is. Here's a quick and dirty map I whipped up in ArcGIS.</p> 
	<center><a href="studyregion.png" target="_blank"><img src="studyregion.png" class="responsive"></a></center>
	<p>&emsp;I split up the study region into six smaller subregions of nine counties. This will come in handy when I am trying to plot everything onto a small multiples chart. There will be one for each region. The major communities of this part of Kansas include Hutchinson, Hays, Dodge City, Garden City, Colby, Pratt, Great Bend, Liberal, and Goodland. Just from looking at the map, the study region takes up over half of Kansas in area, but is smaller in population than the eastern part of the state. The only interstate that runs through this region is Interstate 70. All but one major highway in this part of the country is part of the US Numbered Highway System or the state highways belonging to the Kansas Department of Transportation. Some of the more prominent highways in this region besides I-70 include US-24, US-36, US-40 (most of which has been incorporated into I-70), US-50, US-54, US-56, US-83, US-183, US-283, and US-281.</p>
	<h3 style="border-bottom:1px solid gray;">Cleaning Up the Data</h3>
	<p>&emsp;We will be studying census data from 1890 on a decennial basis up until 2010. One important caveat: in 1890, there was a county that doesn't exist anymore today. Garfield County, Kansas was once its own separate county, but would merge with Finney County by the 1900 Census. On the map drawn above, Garfield County was the little orange part sticking out sandwiched between Gray and Lane Counties. Because of this, I am going to add the population of Garfield County in 1890 to the population of Finney County. This would make the population of Finney County in 4,231 in the year 1890. Don't worry about it though. Using some Excel VBA code and a couple of tricks, I was able to create a CSV file that ggplot would have an easier time handling. <a href="ksdepopulationdata.csv" download>If you want the data for youself, click here.</a> Now, let's get started on the project. First, I have to split up the big dataset into six smaller ones so we can analyze them individually. These represent the six regions I split the study area into, which contain nine counties each. Here's the code I used to create the regions.</p>
	<p class="code">
		&#62; countypop &#60;- read.csv(file="ksdepopulationdata.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")<br>
		&#62; region1 &#60;- countypop[which(countypop$Region==1),]<br>
		&#62; region2 &#60;- countypop[which(countypop$Region==2),]<br>
		&#62; region3 &#60;- countypop[which(countypop$Region==3),]<br>
		&#62; region4 &#60;- countypop[which(countypop$Region==4),]<br>
		&#62; region5 &#60;- countypop[which(countypop$Region==5),]<br>
		&#62; region6 &#60;- countypop[which(countypop$Region==6),]<br>
	</p>
	<h3 style="border-bottom:1px solid gray;">Creating Graphs:</h3>
	<p>&emsp;What we're going to do for this project is to create what's called a small multiple graph, where you can have many graphs packed into one image. Each region has nine counties to them, so we're going to be creating six small multiple charts with nine charts inside each of them. But we need the ggplot2 package in order to do this. If you don't have it already, simply type <code>install.packages("ggplot2")</code> onto your console. Also remember to pick a CRAN mirror closest to you if you are asked to do it. Here's the code I used to create each graph: </p>
	<p class="code">
		&#62; library(ggplot2)<br>
		&#62; ggplot(data = region1, aes(x=Year, y=Population)) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~County)<br>
		&#62; ggplot(data = region2, aes(x=Year, y=Population)) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~County)<br>
		&#62; ggplot(data = region3, aes(x=Year, y=Population)) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~County)<br>
		&#62; ggplot(data = region4, aes(x=Year, y=Population)) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~County)<br>
		&#62; ggplot(data = region5, aes(x=Year, y=Population)) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~County)<br>
		&#62; ggplot(data = region6, aes(x=Year, y=Population)) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~County)<br>

	<h3 style="border-bottom:1px solid gray;">Analysis:</h3>
	<p>&emsp;The data from this project reveals that there are three main inflection points of population in the 20th century. The first was in 1930, which coincides with the Dust Bowl, a disaster that still scars Kansas to this day. Hundreds of people fled Kansas for greener pastures out further west, as people were convinced the state was going to become an uninhabitable wasteland, and that its resources had all been used up. Many counties had a drop in population from 1930 to 1940, especially the ones further west. Multiple counties in Regions 1, 3, and 6 experienced a consistent decline in population following the 1930 Census. This is most visible in Cheyenne and Rawlins, but is also visible in Ness, Hodgeman, Rush, Decatur, Graham, and Phillips Counties. The second major inflection point is 1950, coinciding with the Baby Boom. Advances in technology following World War II allowed for even more efficient and mechanized farming. Some farms hit it big, and became even stronger and richer than ever. But these were mostly factory farms. Ordinary family farms that gave life and jobs to numerous communities in the study region failed, dealing a devastating economic blow to these areas. If you go out to western Kansas, you'll find lots of abandoned farm houses that were sold in the 1950s, and nobody ever bought them, because they would have to be used for farming, and the local farms couldn't compete with the prices of the factory farms and big farms. Cheyenne and Rawlins Counties began declining following the Dust Bowl, and family farms getting put out of business only hastened their decline. Pawnee, Russell, and Trego Counties weathered the Dust Bowl, but began their long decline in population following the mechanization of farming after World War II. The third inflection point is 1970 with the completion of Interstate 70. Out of the 54 counties studied in this project, I-70 only passes through eight of them. After the Dust Bowl and family farms getting put out of business, communities had the chance to rebrand themselves as tourist destinations. But when I-70 was completed, people would often drive right past these towns at 70 to 80 mph, and never even notice they were there. In fact, I-70 completely bypasses Regions 2, 3, and 4 in this study. Many counties in Regions 5 and 6 are also completely bypassed. Rooks County is one county that was bypassed by I-70, and has been consistently declining in population since 1970. The counties where I-70 does pass through have remained somewhat steady in population. Examples include Thomas and Sherman Counties, which contain important economic hubs like Colby, Oakley, and Goodland.</p>
	<p>&emsp;Based on everything I've said so far, you'd think Region 2 would be becoming completely deserted. Well, this isn't quite the case. Since 1940, Haskell, Seward, Stevens, and Grant Counties have actually showed growth in population. Even though these counties were some of the hardest hit by the Dust Bowl, that has not deterred residents of this area from giving up hope, and attracts new residents as we speak. This is because southwest Kansas is home to oil and gas fields, which provide jobs and money for these areas. Communities like Hugoton, Garden City, and Liberal have benefitted from the petroleum industry. Another example of growth in this study is Reno County, which is home to Hutchinson. Hutchinson is the largest community in this study area, with a population of about 40,000, and serves as a satellite city of Wichita, the largest city in the entire state. Hutchinson also serves as a major manufacturing hub, railway hub, and agricultural hub for central Kansas. It is also home to salt mines, the Kansas State Fair, and the Cosmosphere, meaning that Hutchinson is brimming with economic opportunity and tourism compared to most communities studied here. Ford County also has demonstrated growth, even though it is nowhere near I-70. This is because of Dodge City, an important hub to southwestern Kansas, and a world-famous tourism destination, thanks to its history from the days of the Wild West. Ellis County has also demonstrated growth, thanks to Fort Hays State University being located in the city of Hays. This town serves as one of the most important cities in Western Kansas, and provides economic opportunity. College students also have to have somewhere to live, and bedroom communities of Hays like Russell and Ellis benefit from the demand of real estate. Even so, most communities in this half of the state have been in a constant state of decline for decades. Numerous ghost towns have propped up in this part of the country, and many more are expected to within 50 years. Without job opportunities due to the harsh climate and closing of family farms, the children who live in this part of the state move to more populated areas when they grow up, leaving their old towns with a graying population. Without children to enroll in school, the school closes, and families have no reason to live there anymore, as they might have to drive 30 miles just to get their children to school. Then the post office closes, which hampers people's ability to get mail and important products through the Postal Service. By this point, these communities have fallen into an inescapable death spiral, and are destined to become completely abandoned within 50 years.</p>
	<h3 style="border-bottom:1px solid gray;">Conclusions:</h3>
	<p>&emsp;Based on the analysis, I believe that Regions 1, 5, and 6 have declined the most in population. This is mostly because of the decline in the communities north of I-70. Without oil and gas fields to provide jobs like in Region 2, and many communities and counties being bypassed by the interstate, and the comparatively little tourist appeal that towns in other regions have, these communities have seen the largest overall decline in population. And it shows: many small hamlets in these counties are riddled with abandoned farmhouses and ramshackle buildings that used to serve as businesses, exposed to the elements and crumbling. Even though regions 2, 3, and 4 are completely bypassed by I-70, these areas have oil and gas wells, rail hubs, and tourist appeal to provide economic opportunity to convince people to stay. Many counties north of I-70 can't say the same. On an individual county basis, I believe that Cheyenne, Rawlins, Graham, Norton, and Decatur Counties have seen the largest overall decline in population. All five counties are completely bypassed by I-70, suffered from the Dust Bowl, and suffered greatly from the closure of family farms. These counties have not been able to generate the kind of tourist appeal other counties have, thanks to the fact that drivers will simply whiz right by them while driving down I-70. All five counties had a population of 8,000 to 10,000 in the 1920s, and have shrunken down to 2,000 to 4,000 residents, and are still shrinking to this day.</p>
	<p>&emsp;Personally, I think it's very sad to see these communities shrivel up and die. There was once a time where the little towns here were bustling with opportunity, and quickly growing. But the Dust Bowl quickly put an end to all that, and many of these communities have never recovered. Factory farms and I-70 only hastened the process. Just knowing that these towns were once on the rise and families lived and made memories there is very sad to think about. If you are driving around in this part of the state, take some time out of your day to stop by these communities and check them out. It's only a matter of time before they're gone.</p>
