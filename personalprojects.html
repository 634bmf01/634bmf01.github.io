	<p>&emsp;Welcome to my page of personal projects. I don't want the stuff that I learned in school to get rusty, and I also believe it's fun to work with maps and data once I get the hang of what I'm doing. So this is where I show off my personal projects I chose to dedicate my free time to. I don't have anything up yet, but I will get to work on it when I have the time. One day, I hope to have so many of these personal projects up, that I won't be able to fit them all into a dropdown menu like I could with my class assignments. In the meantime, please check out the rest of my website.</p>
