	<p>&emsp;This is my book report that I wrote on the book <i>Flatland</i> by Edwin A. Abbott. Here, you can learn about what happens in the book, the context of the book, a short biography of the author, and how this book relates to the philosophy of mapmaking and displaying data visually. In an age where we live in a perpetually expanding ocean of data that will only continue to grow even faster over the years, it has become important to be able to display information visually, and to do so through multiple channels and dimensions. The human brain is overwhelmed with this deluge of data if non-visual, text-based methods are used. People would have to sift through and read the information for hours and hours, and not everybody is cut out for this kind of mental strain. That's where graphicacy comes in-- the ability to decipher information visually through maps, graphs, and charts-- to save the day for us all. Mapmakers and scientists like me work hard to create maps, charts, and/or graphs that convey copious amounts of data and information in a package that's easier for the average Joe to process. And with information and politics becoming more and more overlapped, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, these skills will be critical to life in the 21st century. The book, <i>Flatland</i> contains a key bit of philosophy that explains everything one would need to know about creating these charts and graphs. Find out all about it here!</p><br>
