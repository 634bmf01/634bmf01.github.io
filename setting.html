	<p>&emsp;Flatland is the titular setting of the book <i>Flatland</i> and serves as the main setting for the book. Everybody lives in a two-dimensional world upon a flat, planar surface. All its inhabitants are geometric figures with "eyes" to see. The first half of the book is set aside for describing the environment of Flatland and all its inhabitants. In the book, the women are line segments and the men are polygons of differing amounts of sides from triangles and squares to octagons, all the way to circles. All the inhabitants of Flatland can move freely about their daily business, but they can't move three-dimensionally like we can. In other words, think about the magnets on your refrigerator if they could move along the surface of the refrigerator doors, but if they were permanently stuck to the door. The only way the magnets could move is along the surface. This goes for the inhabitants of Flatland.</p>
	<p>&emsp;They also cannot see three dimensionally like we can. The inhabitants of Flatland can only see in lines. To get the picture, "[p]lace a [coin] on the middle of one of your tables in Space... [and] gradually lower your eye... [until you are] exactly on the edge of the table..." <a href="bibliography.html">(Abbott, 1884)</a>. Flatlanders cannot look up or down like we can, only left or right. Because the inhabitants of Flatland cannot see in a higher dimension than their own, they are hopelessly ignorant of the concept, and even hostile towards it. They cannot see it, and it is impossible for any of them to comprehend it, therefore it does not exist and is not worth the time to even consider it. A Flatlander's sense of depth and perspective is severely hindered compared to three-dimensional beings like us, since they cannot see height. They compensate for this by using brightness. Closer objects to the subject's "eye" are brighter. Notice how in the diagrams to the right, the yellow pentagon is the closest to the red square's "eye". The pentagon will appear the brightest to the square, and therefore, is the closest to the square. However, a Flatlander would be incapable of comprehending the drawing above the one to the right, since they cannot physically see from the top down. How would one tell a circle apart from a square from a pentagon, and so on? They cannot see angles like we can, so they use something in their world called "Fog" as one method to tell each other apart. In a triangle's case, its sides would quickly recede into the Fog, while a pentagon's sides would not recede as quickly <a href="bibliography.html">(Abbott, 1884)</a>. You could say that triangles would appear as shorter line segments to the inhabitants of Flatland than squares, who are shorter than pentagons, and so on. Even so, sight is very difficult for Flatlanders, making it art form that the upper class is the most skilled at. Flatlanders can feel each other, however, of which the lower class takes advantage of.</p>

	<p>&emsp;Flatland has an extremely rigid class structure with very little social mobility, practically making it a caste system. The more sides you have as a geometric figure, the higher up you are in this system. Women are automatically placed at the bottom of the system, since all women in Flatland are lines, a depiction of how repressed by sexism and misogyny women in Victorian England were. Because women were sharp and pointy enough to stab the male Flatlanders, they are required to make a "peace-cry" <a href="bibliography.html">(Abbott, 1884)</a> at every single instance they were present somewhere. They are also required to wiggle as they move to prevent them from looking like a point to the men, a form of objectification. The men in Flatland are extremely paranoid about the women and what they could do if they were to obtain any power in society, so they put them in a stranglehold of rigid sexuality, sexism, and oppression. Triangles are higher than women, but are still towards the bottom of Flatland's society. They are tasked with the dirty jobs of the world, and are viewed as the most expendable. They are also divided between Isosceles and Equilateral, of which the latter is higher than the former. Squares are higher than triangles and serve as the gentlemen class of Flatland. All of the polygons in Flatland (pentagons, hexagons, octagons, etc.) are part of the upper class of Flatland, and are responsible for running the churches, schools, businesses, and government. The circles are at the pinnacle of Flatland's hierarchy and are the ruling class. They are absolute monarchs and have unquestioned power over the inhabitants of Flatland.</p>
	
	<p>&emsp; As mentioned before, social mobility in Flatland is virtually non-existent. As a result, there are "[hundreds of] other details of our physical existence" <a href="bibliography.html">(Abbott, 1884)</a> that the narrator doesn't even have the time or patience to talk about. In other words, there are hundreds, if not, thousands of rules, legal and social, that almost completely prevent any and all class mobility within one generation. Every time a male is born in Flatland, he will have one more side than his father. For a son, a triangle will have a square, a square a pentagon, a pentagon a hexagon, and so on. Circles have an infinite number of sides, so it would take several generations for a family of triangles to have even one circle. One way the triangles and squares tried to exploit how Flatlanders see was to use color to make one think that they have more sides than they actually do. As a result, all color is forbidden in Flatland. Color is used in the diagrams on this page for our own sake (the three-dimensional beings). Another way polygons could have upended the caste system by appearing to have more sides than they really do is through irregular shapes. But any polygon in Flatland that is born with an irregular side is placed under constant surveillance, may have their side forcefully made regular, or even put to death to keep the caste system intact. This is similar to how in Victorian England, people with physical deformities were viewed as affront to God. But Victorian England had more class mobility than Flatland does, but the social structure of the former was still very rigid. However, the lower class of the former probably believed their country's social structure resembled the latter more. Unlike Victorian England, though, the inhabitants of Flatland, for the most part, are dedicated to preserving the universe's social structure, and are practically brainwashed to be hostile towards other ideas, other beliefs, and especially other dimensions.</p>
